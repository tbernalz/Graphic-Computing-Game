  FaqEntries:
  - Question: Why does my scene look distorted?
    Answer: If your scene's perspective looks strange, you most likely accidentally
      entered <b>Isometric mode.</b> To get back to a normal perspective, click on
      the cube at the center of the Scene view gizmo, which can be found in the upper-right
      corner of the Scene view.
  - Question: I'm lost in the Scene view.
    Answer: If you need to recenter your view of the Scene, try double-clicking on
      the <b>Ground</b> GameObject in the Hierarchy window.
  - Question: I accidentally did something. How do I undo?
    Answer: 'You can undo most actions by pressing <b>Ctrl+Z</b> (macOS: <b>Cmd+Z</b>).
      Some actions, such as changing settings in the Scene view, cannot be undone.
      In this case, try searching on Google, Unity Discussions, or your favorite
      AI Chatbot. '
  - Question: How do I navigate in the Scene view?
    Answer: 'To look around, hold right-click and drag (how you right-click on a
      trackpad can vary, depending on the computer). To fly around the scene, use
      the arrow keys. <b>Note:</b> You can also hold right-click and use the WASD
      keys to fly through the scene. '
  - Question: The scene view looks like a dark blue grid.
    Answer: 'You have most likely entered Prefab editing mode. To exit prefab editing
      mode, go to the Hierarchy window and select the left-arrow to the left of the
      prefab name.  Select image to expand The Scene view will return to the regular
      view of your scene. '
  - Question: Why can't I edit my scene?
    Answer: "If you can't edit your scene, it's possible you're still in Play mode
      or that you've gone into the Game view. Make sure you exit Play mode by clicking
      the Stop button at the top of the Unity Editor. Also make sure that you're
      in the Scene view window \u2014\_not the Game view window."
  - Question: 'Are there shortcuts for the different Scene view tools? '
    Answer: 'Unity''s scene view tools can be accessed with the first keys in the
      top row of your keyboard:  Q (pan), W (move/translate), E (rotate), R (scale). '
